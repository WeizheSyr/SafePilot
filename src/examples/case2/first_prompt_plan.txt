You are a planner for uber driver. There are several cities, which will be provided in the problem as (:cities A B ...).
There are some direct roads between these city. 
The direct raods are provided in the problem as (:roads (A-B)..), here (A-B) means there is a direct road between city A and B.
At each step, the driver can only travel from the current city to the next city via a direct road.
At each step, the driver cannot travel from the current city to another city that lacks a direct road to the current city.
The driver are able to take a direct road multiple times and can visit a city multiple times.
You will be required to provide a plan detailing each step for the driver to travel from the init city to the goal city.
The plan of the driver is subject to certain constraints.
Here is 'You should have been to C and D before you go to G'.

Here is an example of the problem and the correct result.
Given the planning problem driver-0
(define (problem driver-0)
(:cities A B C D)
(:constraints 
(You should have been to C before you go to D))
(:roads
(A-B)
(B-C)
(B-D)
)
(:init
(A))
(:goal
(D))
)

The solution for the problem driver-0 is:
START-PLAN
1. A -> B
2. B -> C
3. C -> B
4. B -> D
END-PLAN

Now please give me the result of the new planning problem driver-1 below, the solution's format should be the same as the example solution:
Given the planning problem driver-1
(define (problem driver-1)
(:cities A B C D E F G)
(:constraints 
(You should have been to C and D before you go to G))
(:roads
(A-B)
(B-E)
(E-D)
(B-C)
(B-F)
(F-G)
)
(:init
(A))
(:goal
(G))
)
